// First, create a separate JS object literal (no constructor functions... yet) for each shop location that does the following:

// Stores the min/max hourly customers, and the average cookies per customer, in object properties

// Uses a method of that object to generate a random number of customers per hour. Objects/Math/random

// Calculate and store the simulated amounts of cookies purchased for each hour at each location using average cookies purchased and the random number of customers generated

// Store the results for each location in a separate array... perhaps as a property of the object representing that location

// Display the values of each array as unordered lists in the browser

// Calculating the sum of these hourly totals; your output for each location should look like this:

// 1st and Pike

// 6am: 16 cookies
// 7am: 20 cookies
// 8am: 35 cookies
// 9am: 48 cookies
// 10am: 56 cookies

// Display the lists on sales.html. We will be adding features to this application and working with its layout throughout the week.
